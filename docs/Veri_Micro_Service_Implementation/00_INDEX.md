## Key Concepts Explained

### Microservices
Each service is an independent application with:
- **Single responsibility** (e.g., authentication, document generation)
- **Independent deployment** (update one service without affecting others)
- **Separate database** (or schema within shared database)
- **Own technology stack** (Python for ML, Node.js for BFF, etc.)

### Docker
Containerization technology that packages each service with its dependencies:
- **Consistent environments** (works the same on dev, staging, production)
- **Isolation** (one service crash doesn't affect others)
- **Scalability** (easily run multiple instances)

### Vietnamese PDPL 2025 Compliance
Vietnam's data protection law requiring:
- **Data residency** (Vietnamese data stays in Vietnam)
- **Regional deployment** (North/Central/South Vietnam)
- **Cultural context** (business practices adapted per region)
- **Vietnamese language** (primary language in all services)

### Strangler Fig Pattern
Gradual migration strategy:
- **Keep old system running** (monolith stays operational)
- **Extract services one by one** (new microservices replace monolith features)
- **Route traffic gradually** (slowly shift users to new services)
- **Decommission monolith** (when all features migrated)

## FAQ

### Q: Can we start implementation now?
**A:** Yes! All planning documents are complete. Start with Phase 1:
1. Set up Docker Compose environment
2. Extract `veri-auth-service` as proof-of-concept
3. Follow [03_Docker_Implementation_Guide.md](./02_Docker_Implementation_Guide.md)

### Q: How long will migration take?
**A:** 64 weeks (16 months) for full production deployment. However:
- **Week 4:** First service operational
- **Week 12:** Core services running
- **Week 32:** Most features migrated
- **Week 64:** Full production with monitoring

### Q: Will there be downtime?
**A:** No. Strangler Fig pattern ensures zero-downtime migration:
- Old monolith runs alongside new services
- Traffic gradually shifted
- Rollback capability at each phase

### Q: What about Vietnamese compliance?
**A:** Built-in from day one:
- All services support Vietnamese timezone
- Vietnamese language primary
- Regional deployment (North/Central/South)
- Data residency enforced
- See [09_PDPL_Compliance_Architecture.md](./09_PDPL_Compliance_Architecture.md) [PENDING]

### Q: Can we deploy to cloud immediately?
**A:** Development first, cloud later:
- **Weeks 1-32:** Docker Compose (local development)
- **Weeks 33-48:** Staging environment (Vietnamese cloud)
- **Weeks 49-64:** Production Kubernetes (multi-region)

### Q: What if we want to skip a service?
**A:** Migration is flexible:
- Each service is independent
- Can prioritize based on business needs
- Can pause migration at any phase
- Monolith can coexist with microservices indefinitely
