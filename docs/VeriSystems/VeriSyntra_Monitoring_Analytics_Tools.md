# Monitoring and Analytics Tools for VeriSyntra Microservices

This document describes three essential tools for logging, monitoring, and visualization in a microservices architecture: ELK Stack, Prometheus, and Grafana.

---

## ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Elasticsearch:** Search and analytics engine for storing and querying log/event data.
- **Logstash:** Data processing pipeline for ingesting, transforming, and forwarding logs to Elasticsearch.
- **Kibana:** Visualization tool for exploring and analyzing data in Elasticsearch, with dashboards, charts, and alerts.
- **Use Case:** Centralized logging, real-time search, and analytics for microservices, infrastructure, and security events.

## Prometheus
- Open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit for reliability and scalability.
- Collects metrics from services/infrastructure using a pull model; stores in a time-series database.
- Supports powerful querying and alerting rules.
- **Use Case:** Monitoring application performance, resource usage, and service health in cloud-native and microservices environments.

## Grafana
- Open-source analytics and visualization platform.
- Connects to Prometheus (and other sources) to create interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- Supports alerting, sharing, and custom plugins.
- **Use Case:** Visualizing metrics, logs, and traces from Prometheus, ELK, and other sources for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.

**Summary Table**
| Tool        | Main Function         | Typical Use Case                        |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| ELK Stack   | Log aggregation/search| Centralized logging, analytics          |
| Prometheus  | Metrics collection    | Monitoring, alerting                    |
| Grafana     | Visualization        | Dashboards, unified monitoring          |

**Guidance:**
- Use ELK Stack for log aggregation and search.
- Use Prometheus for metrics collection and alerting.
- Use Grafana for unified visualization and dashboarding of metrics and logs.
