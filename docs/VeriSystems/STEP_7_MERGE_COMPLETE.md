# Step 7 Merge Complete - No More Confusion!

## What Was Done

Successfully merged Step 7 and Step 7.5 into a **single combined cell** that eliminates the confusing re-run workflow.

## Before (Confusing Workflow)

```
Step 5: Generate base dataset (24,000 samples)
  |
  v
Step 7: Split base dataset (19,200 / 2,400 / 2,400)
  |
  v
Step 7.5: Generate v1.1 augmentation (+ 2,000 samples -> 26,000 total)
  |
  v
RE-RUN Step 7: Split v1.1 dataset (20,800 / 2,600 / 2,600)  <-- CONFUSING!
  |
  v
Step 8: Train model
```

**Problem:** Users naturally run cells sequentially, so they:
1. Run Step 7 (splits base dataset)
2. Run Step 7.5 (creates v1.1)
3. Don't realize they need to RE-RUN Step 7
4. End up training on base dataset (24k) instead of v1.1 (26k)

## After (Clean Workflow)

```
Step 5: Generate base dataset (24,000 samples)
  |
  v
Step 7: v1.1 Augmentation + Split (COMBINED)
  |
  +-- PART 1: Generate v1.1 augmentation (+ 2,000 samples -> 26,000 total)
  |
  +-- PART 2: Split v1.1 dataset (20,800 / 2,600 / 2,600)
  |
  v
Step 8: Train model
```

**Solution:** Single cell that runs sequentially:
1. PART 1: Generate augmentation
2. PART 2: Split the augmented dataset
3. No re-run needed!

## Notebook Changes

### Deleted Cells:
- ❌ Old Step 7.5 description cell (markdown)
- ❌ Mistakenly added Step 7 split cell (from previous attempt)

### Modified Cells:
- ✅ **Cell 24** (markdown): Updated description to explain combined workflow
- ✅ **Cell 25** (code): **NEW Combined Step 7** - Does augmentation + split in sequence

### Final Structure:

```
Cell 24: ## Step 7: v1.1 Augmentation and Dataset Split (Combined)
         [Markdown description]

Cell 25: # Step 7: v1.1 Augmentation and Dataset Split (Combined)
         [Python code - 300+ lines]
         
         PART 1: GENERATE V1.1 AUGMENTATION
         - Generate 500 Cat 2 samples
         - Generate 500 Cat 6 samples
         - Generate 1,000 contrastive pairs
         - Merge with base dataset -> dataset_v11 (26,000 samples)
         
         PART 2: SPLIT AUGMENTED DATASET
         - Split dataset_v11 (80/10/10)
         - Data leakage detection
         - Save train.jsonl, validation.jsonl, test.jsonl

Cell 26: ## Step 8: Load PhoBERT Model and Train
         [Ready for training]
```

## Execution in Colab

### Simple Sequential Execution:
```python
# Run these cells in order (no re-run needed):

1. Run Cell 7  (Step 1: Environment setup)
2. Run Cell 9  (Step 2: PDPL categories + registry)
3. Run Cell 11 (Step 3: Normalizer)
4. Run Cell 13 (Step 4.1: Generator class)
5. Run Cell 15 (Step 4.2: Methods)
6. Run Cell 17 (Step 4.3: Create instance)
7. Run Cell 20 (Step 5: Generate 24k base dataset) [15-20 min]
8. Run Cell 23 (Step 6: Validate dataset)
9. Run Cell 25 (Step 7: COMBINED augmentation + split) [3-5 min]
10. Run Cell 27 (Step 8: Train model) [6-8 min]
```
