# Strategy C Implementation Complete

## Summary of Changes

**Date:** 2025-01-19
**Goal:** Regenerate dataset with stricter leak detection to achieve 90%+ uniqueness and <5% data leakage

---

## Changes Applied

### 1. BUSINESS_CONTEXTS Expansion (Step 2, Cell 9)
**Status:** [COMPLETE]

**Original:** ~5-6 phrases per industry (54 total)
**Updated:** 12 phrases per industry (108 total)

**Impact:**
- Template diversity doubled
- Each industry now has 2x more context variations
- Reduces repetition in generated samples

**Example (Technology industry):**
```python
'technology': [
    # Original 6 phrases
    'ung dung', 'du lieu nguoi dung', 'thong tin tai khoan', 'noi dung so', 'hoat dong truc tuyen', 'dich vu may chu',
    # NEW: 6 additional phrases
    'cong nghe diem sinh hoc', 'thong tin dinh vi', 'hanh vi nguoi dung', 'du lieu cam bien', 'API va tich hop', 'phan tich big data'
]
```

---

### 2. CAT2_DISTINCTIVE_PHRASES Expansion (Step 4.1, Cell 13)
**Status:** [COMPLETE]

**Original:** 25 markers across 3 categories
**Updated:** 54 markers across 4 categories

**Categories:**
- `amount_focus`: 8 -> 18 phrases (+10)
- `minimization_verbs`: 5 -> 13 verbs (+8)
- `unnecessary_markers`: 5 -> 15 markers (+10)
- `quantity_comparisons`: NEW category with 8 phrases

**Impact:**
- 116% increase in Cat 2 vocabulary
- Better differentiation from Cat 1 (Purpose Limitation)
- More variety in QUANTITY/AMOUNT expressions

**Sample additions:**
```python
'amount_focus': [
    'chi yeu cau thong tin toi thieu',  # only request minimum information
    'han che so luong du lieu',         # limit data amount
    'khong thu nhieu hon can thiet',    # don't collect more than necessary
    # ... +7 more
],
'quantity_comparisons': [  # NEW category
    'it hon',         # less than
    'toi da',         # maximum
    'vua du',         # just enough
    # ... +5 more
]
```

### 3. CAT6_DISTINCTIVE_PHRASES Expansion (Step 4.1, Cell 13)
**Status:** [COMPLETE]

**Original:** 24 markers across 3 categories
**Updated:** 52 markers across 3 categories

**Categories:**
- `proof_focus`: 8 -> 18 phrases (+10)
- `accountability_verbs`: 8 -> 18 verbs (+10)
- `authority_markers`: 8 -> 16 markers (+8)

**Impact:**
- 117% increase in Cat 6 vocabulary
- Better differentiation from Cat 0 (Lawfulness/Transparency)
- More variety in PROOF/REPORTING expressions

**Sample additions:**
```python
'proof_focus': [
    'xac thuc tuan thu',      # authenticate compliance
    'chung to du lieu',       # demonstrate with data
    'ho so kiem toan',        # audit records
    # ... +7 more
],
'authority_markers': [
    'co quan thanh tra',      # inspection authority
    'bo quan ly',             # managing ministry
    'to chuc kiem dinh',      # verification organization
    # ... +5 more
]
```

### 4. _check_data_leak Method - STRICT MODE (Step 4.1, Cell 13)
**Status:** [COMPLETE]

**Original Logic:**
```python
# Relaxed: Allow up to 3 occurrences
if current_count >= 3:
    return True  # LEAK DETECTED
```

**Updated Logic:**
```python
# STRICT: Allow only 1 occurrence
if current_count >= 1:
    return True  # LEAK DETECTED - duplicate not allowed
```

**Impact:**
- Enforces 90%+ uniqueness (vs ~60% before)
- Each normalized text can only appear once
- Requires expanded template diversity to avoid infinite loop

**Docstring updated:**
```python
"""Check if sample creates data leak

STRATEGY C: STRICT leak detection for production (90%+ uniqueness):
- Allows ONLY 1 occurrence of same normalized text (changed from 3)
- Prevents exact template duplication (100% unique templates)
- Requires expanded template diversity to avoid infinite loop
- Balances highest quality with feasible generation time
"""
```

---

### 5. max_attempts Increase (Step 4.2, Cell 15)
**Status:** [COMPLETE]

**Original:** `max_attempts = 100`
**Updated:** `max_attempts = 200`

**Rationale:**
- Stricter leak detection requires more attempts to find unique samples
- With 8x template space expansion (480 -> 3,840 patterns per category), 200 attempts is safe
- Prevents false "infinite loop" detection

**Impact:**
- Allows generation to try twice as many combinations
- Reduces risk of RuntimeError due to template space exhaustion
- Expected generation time still acceptable (~20-25 minutes for 24k samples)

---

## Expected Results

### Template Diversity Calculation

**Before Strategy C:**
```
Base templates per category: 16
Context phrases: 30
Total patterns per category: 16 × 30 = 480

For Cat 2 (3,750 samples):
  Duplication factor: 3,750 / 480 = 7.8x
  Expected uniqueness: ~15%
```

**After Strategy C:**
```
Base templates per category: 16 (unchanged, but better variety from expanded contexts)
Context phrases: 60 (doubled)
Distinctive phrases: 54 (Cat 2) / 52 (Cat 6)
Total patterns per category: 16 × 60 = 960

With distinctive vocabulary injection (60% of samples):
  Enhanced patterns: 960 × 54 = 51,840 combinations (Cat 2)
  Enhanced patterns: 960 × 52 = 49,920 combinations (Cat 6)

For Cat 2 (3,750 samples):
  Duplication factor: 3,750 / 51,840 = 0.07x
  Expected uniqueness: ~97%
```

### Data Leakage Reduction

**Before Strategy C:**
```
Base dataset uniqueness: 84.87% (Step 5)
v1.1 dataset uniqueness: 59.73% (Step 7)
Train/Val overlap: 54.2% (1,409 / 2,600)
Train/Test overlap: 54.2% (1,408 / 2,600)
```

**Expected After Strategy C:**
```
Base dataset uniqueness: 90%+ (Step 5)
v1.1 dataset uniqueness: 88%+ (Step 7)
Train/Val overlap: <5% (~130 / 2,600)
Train/Test overlap: <5% (~130 / 2,600)
```

### Model Performance Prediction

**Before Strategy C:**
```
Validation accuracy: 87% (inflated by memorization)
Production accuracy: 75% (true performance)
Gap: 12% (unreliable metrics)
```

**Expected After Strategy C:**
```
Validation accuracy: 85% (true performance)
Production accuracy: 85% (matches validation)
Gap: <2% (reliable metrics)
```

**Expected Time:** Instant
**Expected Output:**
- Template diversity: PASS (improved)
- Sample uniqueness: PASS (90%+)
- Company balance: PASS
- Category balance: PASS
- Ambiguity distribution: PASS

### Phase 3: Execute Step 7 (v1.1 Augmentation + Split)
**Action:** Run Cell 25 (Step 7 Combined)
**Expected Time:** 5 minutes
**Expected Output:**
- PART 1: 2,000 augmented samples generated
  - 500 Cat 2 + 500 Cat 6 + 1,000 contrastive pairs
  - dataset_v11: 26,000 samples

  - test.jsonl: 2,600 samples
  - **Train/Val overlap: <5% (vs 54% before)**
  - **Train/Test overlap: <5% (vs 54% before)**

**Critical Check:**

- Val accuracy <80% (model quality issue)
- Early stopping at epoch 2 (overfitting despite fix)

### Phase 5: Execute Step 9 (Production Testing)
**Action:** Run Cell 29 (Step 9)
**Expected Time:** Instant
**Expected Output:**
- **Production accuracy should match validation (+/- 2%)**
- Cat 2 accuracy: >=70% (target 75%)
- Cat 6 accuracy: >=75% (target 80%)
- Overall accuracy: >=85% (target 88%)

**Success Criteria:**
- Production accuracy >=85%
- Gap between validation and production <3%
- All categories meet minimum thresholds

## Rollback Plan

If Strategy C fails or performance degrades:

### Option A: Partial Relaxation
- Change leak detection threshold from 1 to 2
- Keep expanded vocabulary and contexts
- Target: 80%+ uniqueness, <10% leakage
- Expected time: Re-run Step 5 only (+20 min)

### Option B: Full Rollback
- Revert all changes to original values
- Apply Strategy B instead (deduplicate before split)
- Target: 100% uniqueness in split, smaller dataset
- Expected time: Modify Step 7 only (+5 min)

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
- Strict mode for Cat 2/6 only (confused categories)
- Relaxed mode for other categories
- Target: 85%+ uniqueness, <15% leakage
- Expected time: Modify _check_data_leak (+5 min)

## Contact Points

**If Infinite Loop Occurs:**
1. Check template space: Is it exhausted?
2. Increase max_attempts to 300
3. Consider Option A (partial relaxation)

**If Uniqueness <90%:**
1. Check distinctive vocabulary injection rate
2. Verify BUSINESS_CONTEXTS loaded correctly
3. Review leak detection logic

**If Data Leakage Still >10%:**
1. Verify strict mode active (threshold = 1)
2. Check for normalization issues
3. Apply Strategy B (deduplicate before split)

**If Production Accuracy <85%:**
1. Check if val/prod gap <3% (metrics reliable)
2. If gap large: Leakage still present
3. If gap small: Need more data or better features
