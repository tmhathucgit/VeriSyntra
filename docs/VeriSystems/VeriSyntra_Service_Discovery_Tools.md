# Service Discovery Tools for VeriSyntra Microservices

This document summarizes recommended Service Discovery tools for the VeriSyntra platform, with guidance for Vietnamese enterprise compliance and scalability.

---

## Recommended Tools

### 1. Kubernetes Internal DNS
- **Best for:** Containerized microservices deployed on Kubernetes.
- **Features:** Native DNS-based service discovery, automatic updates as services scale or change, no extra setup required.
- **Integration:** Works seamlessly with Kubernetes networking and orchestration.

### 2. Consul
- **Best for:** Multi-datacenter, multi-cloud, or hybrid environments; advanced health checks; service mesh features.
- **Features:** Service registry, health checking, key/value storage, DNS/HTTP APIs, service mesh integration.
- **Integration:** Can be used alongside Kubernetes or in non-Kubernetes environments; supports PDPL compliance needs.

### 3. etcd
- **Best for:** Kubernetes infrastructure (not direct app-level service discovery).
- **Features:** Distributed, consistent key-value store; stores cluster state and service endpoints.
- **Integration:** Required for Kubernetes clusters; not typically accessed directly by microservices.

### 4. Eureka
- **Best for:** JVM/Spring Cloud microservices (Java-based environments).
- **Features:** REST API for service registration/discovery, load balancing, failover.
- **Integration:** Use only if your services are primarily Java-based.

## Guidance for VeriSyntra
- Use **Kubernetes Internal DNS** for most microservices to ensure robust, scalable, and compliant service discovery.
- Add **Consul** if you need cross-cluster, multi-cloud, or service mesh capabilities.
- Use **etcd** as part of Kubernetes infrastructure (not directly for app-level discovery).
- Use **Eureka** only for JVM/Spring Cloud microservices.
