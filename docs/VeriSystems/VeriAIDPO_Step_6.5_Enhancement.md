# Step 6.5 Enhancement - Dataset Detection Added

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Enhancement:** Added Step 2 vs Step 2.5 dataset detection to Step 6.5 diagnostic

---

## What Was Added

### **New Feature: Automatic Dataset Source Detection**

Step 6.5 now automatically detects which dataset was used (Step 2 Basic vs Step 2.5 Enhanced) and provides dataset-specific analysis and recommendations.

---

## Detection Logic

### **Step 2.5 (Enhanced) Detection:**
```python
if 'enhanced_samples' in locals() or 'enhanced_samples' in globals():
    dataset_source = "Step 2.5 (Enhanced)"
    is_enhanced = True
```

**Indicators:**
- ✅ `enhanced_samples` variable exists
- ✅ Metadata contains `difficulty` field
- ✅ `TEST_ONLY_COMPANIES` defined (anti-leakage)
- ✅ Higher uniqueness rate (95-98%)

**Output:**
```
✅ DETECTED: Step 2.5 Enhanced Dataset
   Total samples: 5000
   Unique texts: 4850 (97.0%)
   Contains difficulty stratification: ✅
   Reserved company sets: ✅
   Anti-leakage mechanisms active
   
   Expected Performance:
   - Epoch 1: 40-60% accuracy (realistic difficulty)
   - Final: 75-90% accuracy (good generalization)
```

### **Step 2 (Basic) Detection:**
```python
elif 'samples' in locals() or 'samples' in globals():
    dataset_source = "Step 2 (Basic)"
    is_enhanced = False
```

**Indicators:**
- ⚠️ `samples` variable exists (not `enhanced_samples`)
- ⚠️ Lower uniqueness rate (~60%)
- ⚠️ No difficulty stratification
- ⚠️ No reserved company sets

**Output:**
```
⚠️  DETECTED: Step 2 Basic Dataset
   Total samples: 5000
   Unique texts: 3000 (60.0%)
   Template diversity: LOW (~30 base templates)
   
   Known Issue:
   - Basic dataset too easy → 100% accuracy epoch 1
   - Instant memorization, poor generalization
   - Recommendation: Use Step 2.5 Enhanced instead
```

## Dataset-Specific Analysis

### **For Step 2.5 (Enhanced):**

#### **Accuracy 75-90% (Target Range):**
```
✅ EXCELLENT: 82.00% accuracy is in target range (75-90%)
✅ Enhanced dataset working as intended!
✅ Model learning PDPL semantics (not memorizing)
✅ Ready for investor demonstration
```

#### **Accuracy >90% (Higher than Target):**
```
⚠️  Accuracy 92.00% higher than target (75-90%)
Possible remaining data leakage (~15-30% inflation)
Consider implementing optional fixes:
   - Fix 4: Reserved context sets
   - Fix 5: Cross-split similarity check
```

#### **Accuracy 60-75% (Slightly Below):**
```
⚠️  Accuracy 68.00% slightly below target
Dataset may be too hard, consider:
   - Increase easy/medium ratio
   - Reduce very_hard percentage
```

#### **Accuracy <60% (Too Low):**
```
❌ Accuracy 45.00% too low
Dataset too difficult or model needs adjustment
```

### **For Step 2 (Basic):**

#### **Accuracy >95% (Overfitting Confirmed):**
```
❌ Accuracy 100.00% confirms overfitting
Basic dataset has only ~30 templates
Model memorized patterns instantly

SOLUTION: Switch to Step 2.5 Enhanced
   1. Set USE_ENHANCED_DATASET = True in Cell 7
   2. Skip Cell 3 (Basic Step 2)
   3. Run Cell 7 (Step 2.5 Enhanced)
   4. Continue with Cells 8-14
   5. Expected: 40-60% epoch 1, 75-90% final
```

---

## Confidence Analysis Enhancement

### **For Step 2.5 (Enhanced):**
```python
if is_enhanced:
    if max_probs.mean() > 0.95:
        print("⚠️  Mean confidence >95% - may still have some memorization")
        print("Expected: More varied confidence (70-95%)")
    else:
        print("✅ Confidence distribution looks realistic")
```

### **For Step 2 (Basic):**
```python
elif is_enhanced == False:
    if max_probs.mean() > 0.95:
        print("⚠️  Mean confidence >95% - confirms memorization issue")
        print("Dataset too easy - model memorized patterns")
```

## Technical Implementation

### **Detection Variables:**
- `enhanced_samples` - Present in Step 2.5
- `samples` - Present in Step 2 (fallback)
- `TEST_ONLY_COMPANIES` - Reserved sets (Step 2.5 only)

### **Metadata Checks:**
- `difficulty` field - Step 2.5 stratification
- Uniqueness rate - 95-98% (Step 2.5) vs ~60% (Step 2)

### **Analysis Branches:**
- `is_enhanced = True` - Step 2.5 path
- `is_enhanced = False` - Step 2 path
- `is_enhanced = None` - Unknown/error

## Usage in Run 4

### **What to Watch For:**

**When running Cell 19 (Step 6.5):**

1. **First output block:**
   ```
   ============================================================
   DATASET VERIFICATION: Step 2 (Basic) vs Step 2.5 (Enhanced)
   ============================================================
   ```

2. **Look for detection message:**
   - ✅ "DETECTED: Step 2.5 Enhanced Dataset" = SUCCESS
   - ⚠️ "DETECTED: Step 2 Basic Dataset" = Wrong dataset used
   - ⚠️ "WARNING: Cannot detect dataset source" = Error

3. **Review performance analysis:**
   - If Step 2.5 detected + 75-90% accuracy = Perfect! ✅
   - If Step 2.5 detected + >90% accuracy = Consider optional fixes
   - If Step 2 detected + >95% accuracy = Switch to Step 2.5
