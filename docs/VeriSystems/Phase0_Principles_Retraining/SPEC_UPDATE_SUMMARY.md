# VeriAIDPO Principles Spec Update Summary

**Date**: October 25, 2025  
**File Updated**: `VeriAIDPO_Principles_Spec.md`  
**Update Type**: Critical alignment with actual Vietnamese training data availability  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

Updated specification to reflect **actual data reality**: 813 lines of premium Vietnamese legal text (PDPL Law 91/2025 + Decree 13/2023) instead of assumed diverse sources (privacy policies, banking docs, e-commerce terms).

**Key Change**: Specification now documents the **28x augmentation strategy** (813 lines → 24,000 samples) using template expansion and synthetic generation while maintaining 100% legal accuracy.

---

## Critical Updates Applied

### 1. ✅ "Sources" Section - CRITICAL UPDATE

**OLD (Incorrect Assumption)**:
```markdown
- Sources:
  - Real Vietnamese privacy policies (anonymized)
  - Banking compliance documents (VCB, Techcombank, VPBank)
  - E-commerce terms (Shopee, Tiki, Lazada)
  - Government circulars (MPS, MIC)
  - Startup privacy notices (tech companies)
```

**NEW (Actual Reality)**:
```markdown
- Sources:
  - Primary Legal Corpus: PDPL Law 91/2025/QH15 (352 lines), Decree 13/2023/NĐ-CP (461 lines)
  - Template Libraries: CompanyRegistry (46 Vietnamese companies), BUSINESS_CONTEXTS (108 industry-specific phrases)
  - Distinctive Markers: CAT2_DISTINCTIVE_PHRASES (54 quantity/comparative markers), CAT6_DISTINCTIVE_PHRASES (52 conditional/reasoning markers)
  - Generation Method: Pattern extraction from 813-line legal corpus → Template expansion → Synthetic formality/regional variations
```

**Impact**: Developers now understand training data comes from legal corpus augmentation, NOT from pre-existing diverse documents.

---

### 2. ✅ NEW SECTION: "Data Augmentation Strategy" - CRITICAL ADDITION

**Added**: Comprehensive 200+ line section explaining the **28x expansion approach**:

**Contents**:
- **Challenge Definition**: 813 lines → 24,000 samples (28x expansion factor)
- **5-Layer Augmentation Pipeline**:
  1. Pattern Extraction (from legal articles)
  2. Template Generation (CompanyRegistry × BUSINESS_CONTEXTS)
  3. Synthetic Formality Transformation (Legal → Formal → Business → Casual)
  4. Regional Flavor Application (North/Central/South post-processing)
  5. Quality Control Pipeline (VnCoreNLP + human review)
- **Example Augmentation Pipeline**: Complete transformation from PDPL Điều 9 to training sample
- **Success Metrics Table**: 8 metrics with targets and methods
- **Why This Approach Works**: 5 advantages of legal corpus augmentation

**Impact**: Clear roadmap for dataset generation from limited source text. Applicable to all 11 VeriAIDPO models (Phases 0-3).

---

### 3. ✅ "Regional Variations" Section - HIGH PRIORITY CLARIFICATION

**OLD (Ambiguous)**:
```markdown
- Regional Variations: 
  - North (Hanoi): 33% - Formal government style
  - Central (Da Nang/Hue): 33% - Traditional business style
  - South (HCMC): 34% - Modern startup/tech style
```

**NEW (Clarified)**:
```markdown
- Regional Variations: 
  - North (Hanoi): 33% - Formal governmental tone (synthetically applied from legal base)
  - Central (Da Nang/Hue): 33% - Traditional business formality (synthetically applied from legal base)
  - South (HCMC): 34% - Modern tech/startup phrasing (synthetically applied from legal base)
  - Note: Source legal text is national standard; regional flavor applied via post-processing
```

**Impact**: Clear that regional variations are **synthetic**, not from authentic regional source documents.

---

### 4. ✅ "Formality Levels" Section - HIGH PRIORITY UPDATE

**OLD (Ambiguous)**:
```markdown
- Formality Levels:
  - Legal (formal contracts): 30%
  - Formal (corporate policies): 30%
  - Business (professional emails): 25%
  - Casual (startup communications): 15%
```

**NEW (Transformation Pipeline)**:
```markdown
- Formality Levels:
  - Legal (formal contracts): 30% - Direct extraction from PDPL/Decree 13
  - Formal (corporate policies): 30% - Legal text rephrased with business vocabulary
  - Business (professional emails): 25% - Legal concepts simplified for corporate use
  - Casual (startup communications): 15% - Conversationalized legal concepts (GPT-4 assisted + human review)
  - Transformation Pipeline: Legal (100% source) → Formal (rephrase) → Business (simplify) → Casual (conversationalize)
```

**Impact**: Documents **how** formality levels are generated from legal base, not from pre-existing casual sources.

---

### 5. ✅ "Dataset Generation Scripts" Section - CRITICAL UPDATE

**OLD (Missing Source Files)**:
```bash
python backend/scripts/generate_principles_vi_v2.py \
  --output-file vietnamese_principles_v2.jsonl \
  --samples-per-category 3000 \
  --difficulty VERY_HARD \
  --regional-distribution north:0.33,central:0.33,south:0.34 \
  --formality-distribution legal:0.30,formal:0.30,business:0.25,casual:0.15 \
  --hard-dataset-strategy \
  --verify-quality
```

**NEW (With Source Files + Workflow)**:
```bash
# Generation Workflow documented first:
Step 1: Extract patterns from PDPL/Decree 13 (813 lines)
Step 2: Generate templates using CompanyRegistry (46 companies) + BUSINESS_CONTEXTS (108 phrases)
Step 3: Apply formality transformations (Legal → Formal → Business → Casual)
Step 4: Apply regional variations (North/Central/South post-processing)
Step 5: VnCoreNLP validation + human QA review

# Script with source files specified:
python backend/scripts/generate_principles_vi_v2.py \
  --source data/pdpl_extraction/pdpl_ocr_text_compact.txt \
  --source data/decree_13_2023/decree_13_2023_text_final.txt \
  --output-file vietnamese_principles_v2.jsonl \
  --samples-per-category 3000 \
  --difficulty VERY_HARD \
  --regional-distribution north:0.33,central:0.33,south:0.34 \
  --formality-distribution legal:0.30,formal:0.30,business:0.25,casual:0.15 \
  --augmentation-strategy template_expansion \
  --quality-control vncorenp+human \
  --uniqueness-target 0.90 \
  --hard-dataset-strategy \
  --verify-quality
```

**Impact**: Scripts now reference **actual source files** and include augmentation strategy parameters.

### 6. ✅ "Template Examples" Section - MEDIUM PRIORITY ENHANCEMENT

**OLD (No generation notes)**:
```python
# HARD (Contextual only, subtle indicators)
"{company} cập nhật thông tin khách hàng định kỳ để đảm bảo dịch vụ tốt nhất."
# → Accuracy (no explicit keywords)
```

**NEW (With generation methodology)**:
```python
# HARD (Contextual only, subtle indicators)
"{company} cập nhật thông tin khách hàng định kỳ để đảm bảo dịch vụ tốt nhất."
# → Accuracy (no explicit keywords)
# Generated from: PDPL Điều 3.3 (accuracy principle) + CompanyRegistry + Business formality

# Note: All examples represent target outputs generated from 813-line legal corpus.
# NOT from pre-existing casual sources - all derived from PDPL/Decree 13 legal framework.
```

**Impact**: Clarifies examples are **generated outputs**, not sourced from existing documents.

---

## Business Impact

### Before Update (Specification Gap)
- ❌ Developers would look for non-existent privacy policy files
- ❌ No clear strategy for 28x data expansion (813 → 24,000)
- ❌ Unclear how to generate regional/formality variations
- ❌ Could delay Phase 0 training by 2-3 days due to confusion

### After Update (Aligned with Reality)
- ✅ Clear source files specified: `pdpl_ocr_text_compact.txt` + `decree_13_2023_text_final.txt`
- ✅ Documented 5-layer augmentation pipeline (pattern extraction → template expansion → synthetic variation)
- ✅ Clear quality control process (VnCoreNLP + human review)
- ✅ **Can proceed directly to Google Colab upload and training**

### Timeline Impact
- **Without spec update**: 2-3 day delay (confusion, re-work, spec clarification needed)
- **With spec update**: 0 delay (clear path to Colab training)
- **Net benefit**: 2-3 days saved on Phase 0, prevents similar delays on Phases 1-3
