## 🔍 Data Leak Detection Logic

### Layer 1: Template Diversity

```python
unique_structures = len(generator.generated_templates)
diversity_ratio = unique_structures / total_samples

if diversity_ratio >= 0.70:
    print("Status: PASS - High template diversity")
```

### Layer 2: Sample Uniqueness

```python
normalized_texts = [sample['text'] for sample in dataset]
unique_normalized = len(set(normalized_texts))
uniqueness_ratio = unique_normalized / total_samples

if uniqueness_ratio >= 0.95:
    print("Status: PASS - Excellent uniqueness")
```

### Layer 3: Company Balance

```python
company_counts = list(generator.company_usage.values())
balance_ratio = min(company_counts) / max(company_counts)

if balance_ratio >= 0.30:
    print("Status: PASS - Well-balanced distribution")
```

### Layer 4: Category Balance

```python
max_deviation = max([abs(count - expected) for count in category_counts.values()])
deviation_pct = max_deviation / expected * 100

if deviation_pct <= 10:
    print("Status: PASS - Excellent balance")
```

### Layer 5: Split Overlap

```python
train_val_overlap = train_texts & val_texts
train_test_overlap = train_texts & test_texts

if len(train_val_overlap) == 0 and len(train_test_overlap) == 0:
    print("Status: PASS - No data leakage")
```

## 🏗️ Key Features Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Company Registry

**Implementation**:
- Inline registry with 46+ Vietnamese companies
- 9 industries: banking, technology, retail, telecommunications, insurance, healthcare, logistics, manufacturing, education
- 3 regions: North, Central, South
- Alias support: 30% chance to use alias instead of canonical name

**Example Companies**:
- Banking: Vietcombank (VCB), Techcombank (TCB), BIDV, Agribank
- Technology: VNG, FPT, Viettel, Shopee Vietnam, Grab Vietnam, MoMo
- Retail: Vingroup, Mobile World, Saigon Co.op, AEON Vietnam

### 2. Company-Agnostic Training

**Normalization Process**:
```python
# Original text with company name
"Vietcombank can thu thap du lieu mot cach hop phap."

# Normalized for training (company → [COMPANY])
"[COMPANY] can thu thap du lieu mot cach hop phap."
```

**Benefits**:
- Model learns principles, not companies
- Works with ANY Vietnamese company
- Hot-reload new companies without retraining
- Scalable to unlimited companies

### 3. Production-Grade Ambiguity

**Distribution**:
- **VERY_HARD (40%)**: Multi-principle overlap, no keywords
- **HARD (40%)**: Regional variations, semantic only
- **MEDIUM (15%)**: Subtle keywords
- **EASY (5%)**: Clear examples

**Example VERY_HARD**:
```python
"Cong ty chi su dung du lieu cho muc dich da thong bao va dam bao bao mat tuyet doi"
# (Overlaps Purpose Limitation + Security)
```

### 4. Company-Agnostic Testing

**Test with NEW companies**:
- Netflix Vietnam
- Apple Vietnam
- TikTok Shop Vietnam
- Microsoft Vietnam
- Samsung Vietnam
- BMW Vietnam

**Validates**:
- Model doesn't memorize company names
- Works with companies never seen in training
- True generalization capability
