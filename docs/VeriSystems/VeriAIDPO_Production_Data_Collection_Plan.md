# VeriAIDPO Production Data Collection Plan

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Status**: Planning (Post-Funding)  
**Target**: 95-97% Accuracy  
**Investment**: $1,500  

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategy for upgrading the VeriAIDPO MVP dataset (4,500 synthetic examples, 90-93% accuracy) to a **production-quality dataset** (5,500+ examples, 95-97% accuracy) by incorporating real-world Vietnamese PDPL data sources.

### Key Differences: MVP vs Production

| Aspect | MVP (Current) | Production (Upgrade) |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Total Examples** | 4,500 | 5,500+ |
| **Cost** | $0 | $1,500 |
| **Accuracy** | 90-93% | 95-97% |
| **Data Sources** | Synthetic only | Synthetic + Real data |
| **Timeline** | Immediate | 4-6 weeks post-funding |
| **Use Case** | Investor demo, POC | Commercial deployment |

---

## MVP Limitations (What Synthetic Data Lacks)

### ✅ What Synthetic Data Covers (75-80% PDPL Alignment)

1. **Core 8 PDPL Principles**: Lawfulness, Purpose limitation, Data minimization, Accuracy, Storage limitation, Integrity/confidentiality, Accountability, Data subject rights
2. **Regional Variations**: Miền Bắc, Miền Trung, Miền Nam dialect support (33%/33%/34% distribution)
3. **Legal Terminology**: Authentic Vietnamese PDPL vocabulary and phrasing patterns
4. **Balanced Distribution**: Equal representation across all 8 categories

### ❌ What's Missing for Production (20-25% Gap)

1. **Specific Article Citations**: No references to actual PDPL articles (e.g., "Điều 12 Luật PDPL 91/2025")
2. **Complex Legal Scenarios**: Simplified examples only, lacks edge cases and multi-category situations
3. **Real Violation Cases**: No actual enforcement actions, fines, or court rulings
4. **Cross-Border Rules**: Missing international data transfer requirements
5. **Sector-Specific Regulations**: No banking, healthcare, e-commerce vertical rules
6. **Regulatory Updates**: Static content, doesn't capture evolving interpretations
7. **Contextual Nuances**: Lacks real-world business scenarios and compliance challenges

## Risk Mitigation

### Legal Risks

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Copyright infringement | Use only public domain legal documents; proper attribution |
| Terms of Service violations | Manual extraction, NO automated scraping without permission |
| Privacy violations in case studies | Anonymize all company and personal names |
| Unauthorized data use | Obtain explicit permission from sector databases |

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Low-quality crowdsourced data | Multi-tier quality control: expert screening + peer review |
| Regional bias | Balance across Bắc/Trung/Nam; recruit experts from all regions |
| Category imbalance | Targeted data collection to fill gaps in underrepresented categories |
| Duplicate content | Automated similarity detection (>85% match = duplicate) |

### Operational Risks

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Expert recruitment delays | Start recruitment immediately upon funding; maintain waitlist |
| Budget overruns | Fixed-price contracts; 10% contingency buffer |
| Timeline slippage | Weekly milestones; parallel workstreams where possible |

## Conclusion

The **Production Data Collection Plan** provides a clear roadmap to upgrade VeriAIDPO from a free MVP (90-93% accuracy) to a commercial-grade product (95-97% accuracy) with a modest $1,500 investment.

### Key Takeaways:

1. **Start Free**: MVP synthetic dataset is sufficient for investor demos
2. **Upgrade Strategically**: Add real data only after securing funding
3. **Balanced Approach**: Combine synthetic (82%) + real (18%) for optimal cost/quality
4. **Focus on ROI**: 3-5% accuracy improvement justifies $1,500 for commercial deployment
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Plan for ongoing data collection post-launch

### Recommended Path Forward:

```
MVP (Now) → Funding → Production Dataset → Commercial Launch → Active Learning
  $0         +$1,500      95-97% accuracy    Revenue generation   Continuous improvement
```
