## Quality Control Framework

### Multi-Tier Quality Assurance

#### Tier 1: Annotator Training (Pre-Annotation)
- **Objective**: Ensure annotators understand PDPL categories
- **Method**:
  - 2-hour training session
  - Practice annotation (10 examples)
  - Quiz on PDPL principles (>80% to pass)
  - Calibration examples (compare with gold standard)

---

#### Tier 2: Real-Time Monitoring (During Annotation)
- **Objective**: Catch errors early
- **Method**:
  - Daily progress checks
  - Random 10% sample review
  - Immediate feedback on errors
  - Weekly calibration meetings

**Quality Metrics**:
```python
# Real-time quality check
accuracy = correct_labels / total_labels
if accuracy < 0.90:
    send_feedback_to_annotator()
    request_revision()
```

---

#### Tier 3: Milestone Review (Post-Annotation)
- **Objective**: Validate bulk submissions before payment
- **Method**:
  - Review 20% random sample per milestone
  - Check accuracy, completeness, language quality
  - Inter-annotator agreement (if multiple annotators)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ >95% accuracy → Approve milestone
- ⚠️ 90-95% accuracy → Request minor revisions
- ❌ <90% accuracy → Reject and re-assign

---

#### Tier 4: Expert Validation (Final Review)
- **Objective**: Ensure production-quality dataset
- **Method**:
  - Vietnamese DPO or law professor reviews 10% of final dataset
  - Validates legal accuracy
  - Checks for bias or systematic errors

**Expert Review Checklist**:
- [ ] Legal accuracy (PDPL principles correctly applied)
- [ ] Language quality (natural Vietnamese, no errors)
- [ ] Regional diversity (balanced Bắc/Trung/Nam)
- [ ] Category balance (each category 10-15%)
- [ ] No duplicate or near-duplicate examples

---

### Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA)

**Method**: Have 2+ annotators label same 50 examples

**Calculate Cohen's Kappa**:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import cohen_kappa_score

annotator1_labels = [0, 1, 2, 0, 3, ...]  # 50 labels
annotator2_labels = [0, 1, 2, 1, 3, ...]  # 50 labels

kappa = cohen_kappa_score(annotator1_labels, annotator2_labels)

# Interpretation:
# kappa > 0.80: Excellent agreement ✅
# kappa 0.60-0.80: Good agreement ⚠️
# kappa < 0.60: Poor agreement (retrain annotators) ❌
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Low Annotator Quality

**Symptoms**:
- Accuracy <90%
- Inconsistent labeling
- Poor understanding of PDPL

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Pre-screening: Require sample submissions
- ✅ Training: 2-hour mandatory orientation
- ✅ Calibration: Practice examples before real work
- ✅ Early detection: Daily quality checks
- ✅ Replacement: Have backup annotators ready

**Contingency**:
- Reject low-quality work (no payment for <90% accuracy)
- Hire replacement annotators mid-project
- Extend timeline by 1 week if needed

---

### Risk 2: Annotator Dropout

**Symptoms**:
- Annotator stops responding
- Misses deadlines
- Incomplete work

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Milestone payments: Only pay for completed work
- ✅ Redundancy: Hire 1-2 extra annotators
- ✅ Clear expectations: Written contract with deadlines
- ✅ Regular check-ins: Weekly progress updates

**Contingency**:
- Have backup annotators on standby (Upwork favorites)
- Redistribute tasks to remaining annotators
- Extend timeline by 3-5 days

---

### Risk 3: Payment Disputes

**Symptoms**:
- Annotator claims non-payment
- Disagreement on quality
- Refund requests

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Use escrow: Upwork holds funds until approval
- ✅ Clear criteria: Written quality standards (>90% accuracy)
- ✅ Documentation: Save all communications and reviews
- ✅ Contracts: Signed agreements before starting

**Contingency**:
- Upwork dispute resolution (for Upwork projects)
- Show evidence of quality issues (screenshots, examples)
- Partial payment for partial work (milestone-based)

---

### Risk 4: Dataset Imbalance

**Symptoms**:
- One category over-represented (>20%)
- Regional bias (>50% one dialect)
- Low diversity in examples

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Clear quotas: Assign specific categories per annotator
- ✅ Regional assignment: Bắc/Trung/Nam annotators balanced
- ✅ Diversity guidelines: Require varied scenarios
- ✅ Real-time monitoring: Check distribution daily

**Contingency**:
- Request targeted examples to fill gaps
- Bonus payment for underrepresented categories
- Generate synthetic examples for missing categories

---

### Risk 5: Technical Issues

**Symptoms**:
- LabelStudio crashes
- Data loss
- Access problems

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Cloud hosting: Use reliable hosting (Heroku, AWS)
- ✅ Backups: Daily exports of annotated data
- ✅ Testing: Test platform before annotators start
- ✅ Support: Provide technical troubleshooting guide

**Contingency**:
- Switch to Google Sheets (simple CSV annotation)
- Use Upwork's built-in file submission (no external tool)
- Extend timeline for technical setup
