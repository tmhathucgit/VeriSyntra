- **Global platforms** like OneTrust and TrustArc are priced for enterprises, not SMEs.
- **Consulting firms** (KPMG, PwC, EY) offer high-touch services but are cost-prohibitive for most Vietnamese SMEs.
- **Local IT providers** (FPT, CMC, Viettel) offer infrastructure-heavy solutions with less automation and slower onboarding.
