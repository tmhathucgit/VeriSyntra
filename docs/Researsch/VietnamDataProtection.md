Comprehensive Contribution Role for Verisyntra: Data Protection Compliance under Vietnam Law (2025) 

 

 

Executive Summary 

Vietnam’s legal landscape for data protection has evolved dramatically, culminating in the enactment of the Personal Data Protection Law (Law No. 91/2025/QH15), effective from July 1, 2025, and supported by the comprehensive Decree 13/2023/ND-CP. These regulations impose stringent obligations on data controllers, data processors, and especially on businesses like Verisyntra handling personal data of individuals in Vietnam. This report aims to provide a robust, fully compliant contribution role suitable for Verisyntra, establishing clear responsibilities, data handling protocols, and compliance measures in line with Vietnam’s legal framework. Further, it leverages international best practices and contextualizes them with local requirements to ensure operational effectiveness, mitigate risks, and bolster trust amongst stakeholders. 

 

 

Vietnam Data Protection Legislation Overview 

Legislative Milestones in Vietnam 

Vietnam’s data protection regime has undergone a rapid transformation over the last few years. The keystone regulation is the Law on Personal Data Protection 2025 (PDP Law), officially Law No. 91/2025/QH15, underpinned by Decree 13/2023/ND-CP, and further supplemented with implementing regulations and guidance from the Ministry of Public Security (MPS). 

This body of law was designed in response to increasing digitalization, cross-border data transfers, and concerns about individual privacy in a data-driven economy. The law fundamentally defines what constitutes personal data and introduces classifications such as basic personal data and sensitive personal data (e.g., biometric, health, financial, location data). Its extraterritorial applicability is clear: all entities—domestic or foreign—engaged in processing personal data of individuals within Vietnam are subject to these provisions. 

The primary legal instruments governing data protection in Vietnam are summarized below: 

Law on Personal Data Protection 2025 (Law No. 91/2025/QH15) 

Decree 13/2023/ND-CP on protection of personal data 

Guidelines and directives issued by the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) 

Ancillary regulations (e.g., on cybersecurity and e-commerce) 

The law establishes comprehensive rules for data collection, processing, storage, disclosure, cross-border transfers, and data breach management, with a strong emphasis on data subject rights and regulatory enforcement mechanisms. 

Key Regulatory Authorities in Vietnam 

The Ministry of Public Security (MPS) is entrusted with supervising, investigating, and sanctioning non-compliance. The law also mandates the appointment of a Data Protection Officer (DPO) and the establishment of a dedicated data protection function within qualifying enterprises. 

 

 

Core Role & Responsibilities: The Data Protection Officer’s (DPO) Contribution at Verisyntra 

Defining the Contribution Role 

At Verisyntra, the Data Protection Officer (DPO), or a similarly titled senior compliance contributor, is pivotal for operationalizing regulatory mandates regarding personal data management in Vietnam. The DPO’s primary mission is to ensure comprehensive and demonstrable compliance with Vietnam’s data protection requirements, while aligning the company’s internal data activities, policies, and strategies to local and global best practices. 

Typical Scope of the Role 

Advisory and Guidance: The DPO serves as the principal advisor on all data protection matters, bridging the gap between business units, IT, legal, HR, and management. The DPO guides the creation, revision, and enforcement of internal policies and procedures per Vietnamese legislation. 

Policy Formulation and Review: Drafting and regularly updating data protection and privacy policies; overseeing impact assessment processes and risk controls. 

Operational Compliance: Overseeing the implementation of lawful data processing practices (lawfulness, fairness, necessity, and data minimization). 

Training and Awareness: Leading or commissioning data protection training for all staff; cultivating a privacy-first organizational culture. 

Data Subject Interactions: Providing frontline response to data subject requests (access, correction, erasure, etc.) under Vietnamese law. 

Incident and Breach Management: Coordinating timely notifications and remediation activities in the event of personal data breaches. 

Regulatory Engagement: Preparing for and responding to audits or investigations by Vietnamese authorities. 

Documentation and Record-Keeping: Ensuring all processing activities are thoroughly documented and records are maintained as required for regulatory inspection.

The table above illustrates the symbiotic relationship between a DPO’s operational tasks and key legal mandates. For Verisyntra, mapping these responsibilities to statutory provisions is essential—not just for compliance, but for effective risk management and strategic governance. 

Contextualizing Responsibilities: Detailed Explanations 

Each responsibility listed above draws from localized legal requirements enhanced with global best practices. For example, the demand for a DPO’s advisory capacity under Vietnamese law resembles the GDPR model (EU) but incorporates additional roles like direct reporting to the MPS and ensuring cross-departmental policy harmonization. Policy formulation, meanwhile, must explicitly address Vietnam’s mandatory provisions on lawful basis, consent, and sensitive data handling, reflected in ongoing documentation, risk assessments, and employee communications. 

For effective operational compliance, a DPO must harmonize data flows across the organization. This involves not just ensuring minimal, proportional data collection (data minimization) and explicit consent mechanisms, but also putting in place audit trails, technical controls, and periodical reviews of data lifecycles. 

Training and awareness are not one-off activities—they encompass recurring programs customized to language, culture, and local risk context. Data subject rights fulfillment is a frontline obligation, particularly where individuals must be empowered to review, correct, or withdraw consent regarding their personal data. 

Incident and breach management obligations are highly prescriptive in Vietnam, with clearly defined timelines and documentation procedures required for notifying the MPS and affected data subjects in the event of significant breaches. All of these activities must be underpinned by robust documentation—both to comply with periodic authority inspections and to enable swift, auditable response to data protection concerns. 

 

 

Data Handling Practices in Vietnam 

Lawful Basis for Data Collection and Processing 

Vietnam’s law mandates that all personal data processing must be grounded on one of several legal bases: consent (as the default), contractual necessity, legal obligation, protection of interests, or legitimate interests. Consent remains the core principle—explicit, clear, freely given, and easily revocable. Where processing involves sensitive data, the requirements for consent and risk assessment heighten due to the presumed risks of harm to the data subject. 

Processing must be necessary, relevant, and not excessive for the purposes identified. Furthermore, the law stipulates data minimization—only collect what is strictly necessary—and prohibits the use of personal data for secondary purposes without renewed consent. 

Data Subject Rights: Implementation in Practice 

Vietnamese law empowers data subjects with extensive rights analogous to those under the GDPR, such as: 

The right to be informed: Individuals must be notified regarding the nature and purpose of processing at the time of collection. 

Access rights: Data subjects may request details of data collected and processed about them. 

Rectification/Correction: Errors in personal data must be corrected upon request without undue delay. 

Erasure (“right to be forgotten”): On justified grounds, individuals may require deletion of their data. 

Consent withdrawal: Revocation must be as simple as granting consent. 

Restriction of processing: Under certain circumstances, processing must be limited as per the data subject’s request. 

Object to processing: Especially relevant for marketing or profiling activities. 

Verisyntra’s DPO is responsible for establishing clear, user-friendly processes and forms to facilitate these requests in a timely, documented, and secure manner. Each request, its handling, and eventual outcome must be meticulously recorded to ensure compliance and prepare for regulatory review. 

Data Storage, Retention, and Destruction 

Vietnamese regulations provide that personal data must be stored securely for no longer than necessary to fulfill the original or legitimately extended purpose. Data should be irreversibly deleted, anonymized, or securely destroyed once the retention period ends, barring legal requirements or authorized extensions. The DPO oversees the formulation of a comprehensive data retention schedule that specifies timelines and secure disposal protocols for all major data categories. 

Notification and Transparency 

Organizations are required to provide transparent, concise, and easily accessible notices to individuals about their data handling practices, including but not limited to identity and contact of the controller, data types collected, processing purposes, retention duration, right of withdrawal, and data sharing with third parties or transfers abroad. Notice templates must be comprehensible and made available in Vietnamese. 

Security Measures 

All personal data must be protected using “appropriate technical and organizational measures.” Vietnamese law references pseudonymization, encryption, access controls, periodic review of security protocols, and incident detection. Verisyntra’s DPO will coordinate with IT and security teams to enforce and periodically assess these controls, aligned with both local MPS guidance and evolving international standards (such as ISO 27001). 

 

 

Compliance Measures: Vietnam-Specific Considerations 

Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) 

Under Vietnamese law, DPIAs are mandatory for processing sensitive personal data or when new high-risk activities are introduced. DPIAs must analyze processing purposes, assess potential harms, and propose mitigation measures. Completed impact assessments must be filed with the MPS for certain high-risk activities or cross-border transfers, and be available for audit on request. 

Cross-Border Data Transfer Requirements 

Vietnam’s PDP Law imposes some of the region’s strictest controls on cross-border transfers. These include: 

Mandatory impact assessments: Before transferring data overseas, a risk analysis must be performed to evaluate impacts on national interests and data subject rights. 

Prior notification/approval: In specific scenarios, especially with sensitive data, prior notification or approval from the MPS is required. 

Contractual safeguards: Data transfer agreements must specify the receiving party’s data protection obligations and commitment to Vietnamese law equivalence. 

Onshore storage and duplication: In certain cases deemed sensitive for national security, Vietnamese authorities may require onshore data retention or duplication. 

This means Verisyntra’s DPO must work closely with legal teams and IT to ensure no personal data leaves Vietnam without a relevant transfer mechanism, comprehensive DPIA, and (where required) regulatory approval. 

Third-Party Vendor and Processor Oversight 

Data sharing with third parties (processors or controllers) is highly regulated. All third parties must undergo due diligence and be contractually bound to comply with Vietnamese law. DPOs are responsible for vetting all vendors, ensuring contracts cover data protection clauses aligned with the PDP Law, and monitoring ongoing compliance through regular audits and assessments. 

Vendor assessments typically scrutinize: 

Adequacy of technical safeguards 

Existence of data breach management plans 

Record keeping and documentation 

Subcontractor policies 

Immediate documentation of due diligence and management of sub-processors is a legal and practical requirement, especially in sectors like finance, technology, and healthcare. 

Breach Notification and Incident Response 

Vietnamese law stipulates prompt breach notifications: 

To authorities: Report to the MPS within 72 hours of becoming aware of a significant personal data breach. 

To data subjects: Individuals must also be notified when the breach could result in material harm. 

Documentation: Maintain a log of breaches, incident remediation, and communications. 

The DPO designs and periodically tests an incident response plan, encompassing detection, escalation, investigation, corrective action, and notification processes. 

Training and Awareness Programs 

Regular, role-specific data protection training is a legal requirement and a global best practice. DPOs at Verisyntra must ensure induction and refresher training sessions, tailored for different risk profiles and responsibilities. This includes simulation of data subject requests, breach scenarios, and updates on changes to Vietnamese regulations and global trends. 

Record Keeping and Documentation 

Vietnam places strict record-keeping obligations on data controllers and processors. DPOs must ensure complete and up-to-date registers of processing activities, consent logs, data transfer documentation, risk assessments, contracts, and training records. These records must be readily accessible for MPS inspection or upon regulatory request. 

Audit and Monitoring 

Internal audits, both scheduled and ad hoc, are necessary to validate ongoing compliance. These include reviewing operational practices, security controls, contract compliance, training efficacy, and the fulfillment of data subject requests. Independent audits (internal or by third parties) are encouraged to ensure objectivity. 

Enforcement, Penalties, and Remediation 

Violations of Vietnam’s data protection law attract significant sanctions, including administrative fines (up to hundreds of millions of VND), suspension of data processing activities, and—potentially—criminal liability for the most serious offences. DPOs must ensure that all compliance failures are met with prompt, documented remediation plans, and cooperate fully with authorities during investigations or enforcement actions.

Decree 13/2023/ND-CP: Detailed implementation regulations, including requirements for consent, breach notification, and data processing contracts. 

Guidelines and FAQs issued by the Ministry of Public Security: Moderating practical implementation, responding to sector-specific concerns. 

Enforcement Regulations: Outline penalties, investigation procedures, and compliance audit requirements. 

All policies, procedures, and DPO activities at Verisyntra must be meticulously cross-referenced to these legal texts, ensuring no ambiguity in interpretation or application. 

 

 

Comparative Examples: Multinational Companies in Vietnam 

Case Study: Tech Giants and Financial Institutions 

Google and Meta (Facebook): Both companies, after the introduction of PDP Law, adjusted their Vietnam-specific privacy practices by localizing data storage, appointing local DPOs, and implementing country-specific consent and notification templates. Google’s Vietnam privacy statement, for instance, now provides explicit Vietnamese language notices, direct contacts for data subject requests, and tailored cross-border transfer policies. 

HSBC Vietnam: Adopted a dedicated DPO reporting to both Vietnam and Asia-Pacific headquarters, with explicit alignment to Decree 13/2023/ND-CP. HSBC’s DPO leads quarterly training, annual policy reviews, and routine audits, and ensures that all third-party processors in Vietnam execute PDP Law-compliant contracts. 

Microsoft Vietnam: The local DPO coordinates closely with compliance units to ensure data residency, onshore storage per MPS guidelines, and the application of international certifications (such as ISO 27701) for all Vietnam data centers. 

These organizations typically implement layered governance—establishing local DPOs with a dotted-line report to global data protection offices, continuous improvement roadmaps, and regular liaison with sectoral regulators. 

Analysis of Best Practices from Other Jurisdictions 

International best practices, especially from the EU’s GDPR regime and Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), often inform Vietnamese compliance approaches. Key adopted measures include: 

Mandatory DPO appointments for entities processing sensitive or large-scale data. 

Granular consent management platforms (CMPs) to secure, evidence, and withdraw consent digitally. 

Embedded privacy-by-design in IT systems and service rollouts. 

Use of Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) before launch of high-risk projects. 

Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) or Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for cross-border transfers. 

Vietnam’s law, however, expects even foreign SaaS providers or global e-commerce players to appoint local DPOs, document in Vietnamese, and prepare for on-site MPS audits. 

 

 

Data Subject Rights Management at Verisyntra 

Effective data subject rights management is a cornerstone of both Vietnam’s regulatory approach and stakeholder trust. The DPO at Verisyntra must: 

Develop and Publish Accessible Rights Procedures: Clearly written, Vietnamese language guidance explaining rights, how to exercise them, and estimated timelines must be made available on all digital platforms and in physical formats where applicable. 

Implement Automated and Manual Processing Channels: Establish webforms, emails, phone lines, and in-person channels—ensuring redundancy and accessibility. 

Ensure Authentication and Record-Keeping: Authenticate requestors securely and document every stage of the request, resolution, and outcome. 

Monitor Fulfillment Timelines: Integrate request deadlines into case management systems, providing periodic reports on fulfillment metrics. 

Prepare Reporting Channels: Enable rapid notification and escalation to management and the MPS as warranted. 

The DPO customizes internal workflows so that all privacy teams, customer service representatives, and front-line managers are trained and empowered to escalate and resolve rights requests efficiently. 

 

 

Data Breach Notification Procedures 

Vietnam’s regime introduces specific, short-timeframe obligations for breach notification under the PDP Law: 

Internal Discovery and Investigation: Immediate internal escalation protocols, pre-mapped incident response teams, and IT forensics engagement. 

Regulatory Notification: For material breaches, DPO must inform the MPS within 72 hours. Incidents affecting national security, banking, or large numbers of individuals may require faster escalation. 

Data Subject Notification: Where breaches are likely to result in significant harm, affected individuals must be informed directly, with guidance on remedial steps they can take. 

Documentation: Maintain incident logs, investigation outcomes, communication records, and post-breach remediation plans. 

Examples from regional banks and cloud companies reveal that mock breach drills (“tabletop exercises”) are run quarterly at major firms, reviewed by the DPO and security teams, and lessons incorporated into ongoing risk management. 

 

 

Cross-Border Data Transfer: Policy and Practice Requirements 

Vietnamese law is explicit: data may only leave the country if the following criteria are met: 

A completed and approved Data Transfer Impact Assessment (DTIA) 

Notification to, or approval from, the MPS for some transfers 

Binding contractual guarantees from the overseas recipient regarding equivalent protection standards 

Clear evidence of Vietnamese data sovereignty, including onshore storage or duplication when mandated 

For Verisyntra, this means mapping all cross-border data flows, evaluating risk, documenting the controls in place, and—when in doubt—seeking additional guidance from the MPS. Leading financial institutions have navigated this by implementing data localization for customer data and establishing cloud contracts with Vietnamese jurisdiction clauses. 

 

 

Third-Party Vendor Management 

Verisyntra’s DPO plays an active role in: 

Establishing a third-party risk register to map all data-processing vendors. 

Conducting pre-contractual due diligence, assessing capacity, prior compliance, security certifications, and regulatory history. 

Requiring contractual data protection clauses, including direct liability for non-compliance and breach notification obligations. 

Monitoring and auditing third-party performance through scheduled reviews and independent assessments. 

Recent enforcement actions in Vietnam highlight the critical importance of proactive vendor management: businesses have faced sanctions and public censure for failing to adequately vet or monitor vendors handling sensitive client or HR data. 

 

 

Data Protection Training and Awareness at Verisyntra 

Continuous, tailored data protection training is both a legal requirement and a business imperative. The DPO at Verisyntra is tasked with: 

Developing onboarding modules covering PDP Law basics, company policies, breach protocols, and data subject rights. 

Scheduling refresher programs at least annually, or upon major regulatory or technological changes. 

Delivering scenario-based learning, supported by real and simulated incident reviews. 

Customizing content, differentiating between high-risk roles (IT, HR, marketing) and general staff. 

Maintaining detailed attendance and assessment records. 

Local and multinational firms in Vietnam regularly use these programs to demonstrate a culture of compliance to regulators during audits and as mitigation in case of inadvertent breaches. 

 

 

Audit, Monitoring and Record-Keeping under Vietnam Law 

Internal and external audits validate that Verisyntra’s data protection policies are not just robust on paper, but effective in practice. Practical steps include: 

Annual Audits: Mandatory review of data processing activities, documentation, and control effectiveness. 

Spot Checks: Random, unscheduled operational assessments. 

Regulatory Reporting: Preparation for MPS inspection; readiness to disclose records, impact assessments, and incident logs. 

Data Protection Registers: Continuous, up-to-date tracking of processing activities, cross-border flows, decisions, and data subject interactions. 

DPOs surveyed in 2025 reported that audit fatigue is a risk. To counter this, major companies invest in privacy management technology to automate record-keeping, trigger alerts for missing documentation, and streamline regulatory reporting. 

 

 

Enforcement Environment: Penalties and Remediation 

Vietnam’s enforcement has transitioned from warning letters and compliance “encouragement” to active investigations, fines, and orders to suspend processing. The law establishes the following enforcement mechanisms: 

Administrative Sanctions: Fines ranging from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of VND, applied according to the type and scale of infringements. 

Data Processing Suspension: Temporary or permanent suspension for egregious violations. 

Reputational Harm: Public censure and loss of market/community trust following breaches or high-profile enforcement actions. 

Criminal Liability: For significant infractions or recidivism, especially involving sensitive data or cross-border violations. 

The DPO must ensure: 

Immediate internal correction and remediation upon identifying compliance gaps. 

Transparent and constructive cooperation with authorities during investigations. 

Comprehensive analysis of root causes after each incident, with documented improvement and learning.
