| **Series B** | 1 (CEO) | 2 | 2 | Founder-friendly independents |

## 🔧 **Specific Adaptations for Single Founder**

### **1. Early Team Equity Strategy**
Since you don't have co-founders, consider:

#### **Key Executive Equity Allocation:**
- **CTO**: 2-5% equity + board observer seat (founder ally)
- **COO**: 1-3% equity + operational authority
- **VP Engineering**: 0.5-2% equity + technical leadership
- **VP Sales**: 0.5-2% equity + revenue responsibility

#### **Advisory Board Creation:**
- **Technical Advisors**: 0.1-0.5% each for AI/Vietnamese expertise
- **Business Advisors**: 0.1-0.5% each for Vietnamese market knowledge

- **Employee Shares**: 5:1 voting ratio (vs. 1:1)
- **Investor Shares**: 1:1 voting ratio

**Example with Enhanced Protection:**
```
Founder: 50% equity × 15 votes = 750 voting power
Employees: 10% equity × 5 votes = 50 voting power
Investors: 40% equity × 1 vote = 40 voting power
Total Founder Control: 750/(750+50+40) = 89% voting control
