```
Founder: 50% equity √ó 15 votes = 750 voting power
Employees: 10% equity √ó 5 votes = 50 voting power

```
Founder: 60% equity √ó 15 votes = 900 voting power
Employees: 10% equity √ó 5 votes = 50 voting power
Investors: 30% equity √ó 1 vote = 30 voting power  
Founder Control: 900/(900+50+30) = 92% voting control
```

**Post-Series B (55% total dilution):**
```
Founder: 45% equity √ó 15 votes = 675 voting power
Employees: 15% equity √ó 5 votes = 75 voting power
