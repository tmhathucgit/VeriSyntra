Based on your investor research document and the extraordinary financial projections ($1.25B revenue, 99% margins), here are strategic ways to maintain founder control while raising capital:

## 🎯 **Founder Control Strategies**

### **1. Dual-Class Share Structure**
**Most Effective for Long-term Control**

- **Class A Shares**: 1 vote per share (for investors)
- **Class B Shares**: 10 votes per share (for founders)
- **Control Mechanism**: Maintain voting control even with minority equity ownership
- **Example**: You keep 15% equity but 51% voting control through 10:1 voting rights

**Implementation**:
```
Founder Holdings: 15% equity × 10 votes = 150 voting power
Investor Holdings: 85% equity × 1 vote = 85 voting power
Founder Control: 150/(150+85) = 64% voting control
```

### **2. Strategic Equity Retention Timeline**
